rnn-final: Houses the 2 vanilla RNN classes, the classical sweep, a beam search and relevant evaluations.

attention-final: Houses the attention RNN class, a beam search and relevant evaluations.

analysis: Uses all the output csvs and attention weights to generate and log various plots.

challenge: Used the attention model outputs and weights to generate the required visual. Has a toy example at the end in case using the dataset is too tedious.

For all notebooks, kindly make sure the working directory and the directory of the downloaded dataset are the same. Kindly reach out to us if any of the notebooks throws errors surrounding the location of directories.

Thank you! :)
